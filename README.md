In today's digital era, real-time communication has become an essential component of online interactions. Whether in the context of social networking, business collaboration, or customer support, the demand for instant messaging applications has grown significantly. This project focuses on the development of a Real-time Chat Application that enables users to exchange messages instantly, providing a fast, efficient, and interactive communication experience.

The application is built using the React.js framework for the frontend, which allows the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, and Socket.io is used to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server. This technology stack ensures that messages can be sent and received in real time without the need for page reloads or continuous polling.

Unlike traditional messaging systems that rely on HTTP requests and page refreshes, this real-time chat application leverages WebSockets, which maintain an open connection between the server and connected clients. This enables immediate message delivery, typing indicators, and online status updates.
